# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
semantic versioning for the rule set.

## [2.0.0]

### Changed
- **Modernized for Rust 1.96 (2024 edition).** Updated throughout for the
  Rust 2024 edition and current stable (Rust 1.96): RPIT lifetime capture
  rules, `unsafe extern` blocks, `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]`, `if let` chains
  (1.88), `core::hint::cold_path` (1.95), `core::hint::select_unpredictable`
  (1.88), `Atomic*::update` (1.95), `core::range::Range` (1.96),
  `assert_matches!` (1.96), `From<T> for AssertUnwindSafe<T>` (1.96),
  `<[T]>::array_windows` (1.94), `<[T]>::as_chunks` (1.88), trait object
  upcasting (1.86), `#[diagnostic::do_not_recommend]` (1.85),
  `cargo publish --workspace` (1.90), Tokio 1.52+ APIs, async-std
  discontinued (March 2025).
- Depth pass: expanded `own-rc-single-thread` (breaking cycles with `Weak`, the
  `Rc::clone` idiom, `strong_count`/`weak_count`, `!Send`/`!Sync`) and
  `own-refcell-interior` (`Cell` for `Copy` types).
- Added cross-references from ~18 foundational rules to the newer categories
  (`conc-`, `conv-`, `num-`, `serde-`, `trait-`, `closure-`, `coll-`, `pat-`)
  for better navigation between related rules.

Now 324 rules across 26 categories.

## [1.5.1] (skipped in changelog; documented here retroactively)

### Changed
- Depth pass: expanded `own-rc-single-thread` and `own-refcell-interior`.

## [1.5.0]

### Added
- **Const & Compile-Time** category (`const-`, 4 rules): `const fn`, `const` vs
  `static`, const generics, inline `const { }` blocks.
- **Trait & Generics Design** category (`trait-`, 6 rules): static vs dynamic
  dispatch, associated types vs generic params, default methods, blanket impls,
  object safety, the orphan rule + newtype.
- **Collections** category (`coll-`, 4 rules): map choice (HashMap/BTreeMap/
  IndexMap), sequence choice (Vec/VecDeque), set membership, `BinaryHeap`.
- `checks/gen_index.py` — generates `SKILL.md`'s priority table and Quick
  Reference (and the rule counts) from `rules/` so the index can't drift; CI
  runs it in `--check` mode.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and this `CHANGELOG.md`.

Now 265 rules across 26 categories.

## [1.4.0]

### Added
- **Closures** category (`closure-`, 5 rules): Fn/FnMut/FnOnce bounds, returning
  `impl Fn`, `move` capture, static vs dynamic dispatch, disjoint capture.

Now 251 rules across 23 categories.

## [1.3.0]

### Added
- **Serde** category (`serde-`, 8 rules): rename_all, default, skip, flatten,
  enum representation, deny_unknown_fields, custom (de)serialize, validate-on-
  deserialize.
- **Numeric & Arithmetic Safety** category (`num-`, 5 rules): explicit overflow
  handling, `as` vs `TryFrom`, float comparison, clamping, `NonZero`.

Now 246 rules across 22 categories.

## [1.2.0]

### Added
- **Macros** category (`macro-`, 8 rules): declarative-macro hygiene and
  fragment specifiers, and procedural-macro design with `syn`/`quote`.
- **Observability** category (`obs-`, 7 rules): `tracing`, spans, structured
  fields, error chains, and keeping secrets out of logs.

Now 233 rules across 20 categories.

## [1.1.x]

### Added
- **Unsafe Code** (`unsafe-`), **Concurrency** (`conc-`), **Conversions**
  (`conv-`), and **Pattern Matching** (`pat-`) categories, plus new rules across
  existing categories — 39 rules in total.
- A compile-check harness (`checks/`) and a GitHub Actions CI workflow that
  validates rule structure, links, the index, and that examples compile.

### Changed
- Updated throughout for the Rust 2024 edition and current stable (Rust 1.96):
  RPIT lifetime capture rules, `impl Trait` in traits, `collect_into` status,
  `resolver = "3"`, `env::set_var` now `unsafe`, and more.

Now 218 rules across 18 categories.

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Initial release: 179 rules across 14 categories.
